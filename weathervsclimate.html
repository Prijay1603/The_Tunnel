    <h2>What is the Difference Between Weather & Climate?</h2>
    <img id="weathervsclimatepic1" src="weathervsclimatepic1.jpeg" height="400px"><br><br>
    <p class="info">Although there are common misconceptions when dealing with weather and climate, they are two dissimilar things. Weather is actually the temperature and the rainfall over a particular area at any given moment. However, climate is what the same statistics are, but for a longer period of time. For example, Fordeâ€™s weather is 9<sup>o</sup>C. However, the climate is 17.2<sup>o</sup>C. An easier example to understand would be the Sahara Desert. Its weather is 40<sup>o</sup>C with no rain. Whereas the climate is dry and arid. This links to the story because if the weather changes for one day, it does not matter. The weather has to be consistently different to change the climate.</p>
