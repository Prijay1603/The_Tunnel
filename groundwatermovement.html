    <p class="info" id="winfo">Groundwater movement can also be called <i>groundwater recharge</i>. During droughts, the water table falls, this is due to most of the water <a href="evaporation">evaporating.</a> During other times of the year and other places on Earth, the water table rises, this is due to the amount of water that has been <a href="waterdistribution.html">distributed around the world.</a> Sometimes, the water can even move from one part of the Earth to the other just by going through the soil. This is how it relates to the story, if the water could travel around the Earth through the aquifers, the toxins would also travel with it.</p>
