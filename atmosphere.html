    <h2>Atmosphere.</h2>

    <br><br><p class="info">An atmosphere is a thin layer of gas that surrounds planets. It is made up of 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen & 1% Other gases. Atmospheres are essential for life on Earth as they have many layers that serve a variety of purposes.</p>
    <p class="info">The troposphere is the closest to the Earth’s surface and it is 8 – 14 kilometres thick depending on the climate. The colder the climate, the thinner it is, the hotter the climate, the thicker it is. The word <i>Tropos</i> literally translates to <i>change</i>. This is due to the fact that the gases in this part of the atmosphere are always changing. This zone contains the air we breathe and clouds. As it is the densest layer, it is at the bottom of the atmosphere. This is also where all the weather balloons stay. This is the precise layer that was mentioned in the main story.</p>
    <p class="info">The Stratosphere is 35 kilometres thick. The word <i>Strat</i> means <i>layer</i> this is because there are multiple layers contained in this layer. In this layer, there is no turbulence, this means the hot air rises and the cool air descends. This layer also contains the Ozone layer. The Ozone layer is the layer that absorbs most of the Sun’s UV rays. This is the highest most planes and jets can reach.</p>
    <p class="info">The Mesosphere is also 35 kilometres thick. The word <i>Meso</i> means <i>middle</i>. This is because this is the last layer where all the gases are combined instead of sorted by their mass. This is where many meteors are burning up. This is because the thermosphere above it does not have enough air to cause friction to burn the asteroids. However, the Mesosphere is rich in air this causes friction which in turn creates heat. Due to this immense heat, the meteorite burns up.</p>
    <p class="info">The Thermosphere is where the Aurora lights are created. <i>Thermo</i> means <i>heat</i>. The temperature in this layer can reach up to 2482.222OC. This is also where you can find all sorts of low – flying satellites as this layer is about 513 kilometres thick.</p>
    <p class="info">The Exosphere is at the edge of the Earth’s atmosphere. The word <i>Exo</i> means <i>outer</i>. This layer is approximately 10,000 kilometres thick. The gases found here are mainly Hydrogen and Helium. However, they is a considerable amount of space in between these particles. There is no Oxygen that can be breathed by humans.</p>
