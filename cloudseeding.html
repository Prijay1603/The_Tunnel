    <p class="info">Cloud seeding is where people fly up to the troposphere and release huge amounts of salt into potential clouds. This is done for two main purposes, 1. To force rain to fall when there is a drought. 2. To increase the amount of rain that is falling. However, there are certain conditions for when you can actually grow clouds. Such as, it has to have been a rainy year. The clouds themselves also have to be between -10OC and -12OC. This method of artificially condensation is most effective in the mountainous areas due to the wind speed being low. In the story, Mike used cloud seeding so that he could make clouds grow. While injecting salt onto the little clouds, he also injected toxins so that the water vapor would absorb them.</p>
