    <h2>Water Distribution</h2>
    <img id="waterdistributionpic1" src="waterdistributionpic1.PNG" height="400px"><br><br>
    <p class="info">Around 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by water. Of this, 96.5% is in the oceans. Water also exists in the air in the form of water vapor. It also exists in rivers, lakes, icecaps, glaciers, in the ground as soil moisture as well as in aquifers, and even in you and your body. </p>
    <p class="info">You can also notice that there is not much water in countries near the equator. This is due to fact that it is constantly being evaporated due to the dry, arid climate. This is also why it only rains a few millimetres per year.</p>
