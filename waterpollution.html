    <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
    <img id="waterpollutionpic1" src="waterpollutionpic1.PNG" height="400px"><br><br>
    <p class="info">Water can be polluted by almost anything, plastic, nuclear waste, fertilizers etc. The literal definition of <i>water pollution</i> is to make water unusable for consumption. <i>Consumption</i> can be anything, from drinking to washing clothes, dishes, and body. As water is an <b>essential</b> resource, it is important we maintain it. Without water, all life on Earth would perish. This is because everything drinks water. An example of how everything will die is, koalas get their water from the leaves they eat. However, the leaves are attached to a tree, and if the tree does not receive enough water, it will die and so will the koala. Also, if you as a human does not receive enough water, you will be dehydrated and you will also die. In the story, this is referring to the government’s action against water pollution. In Mike’s plan, if he poisoned the water, the government would blame water pollution and so they would attempt to clean the water.</p>
