    <p id="winfo">Salinity is how much salt is in the water. If there is a high level of salinity, the water is extremely salty. The saltiest water on Earth can be found in the Atlantic ocean. Most of the water with a high level of salinity is normally found in open water while the water with the lowest level of salinity is found in frozen ice caps as well as in small lakes. In the story, Gerome spits out the water he was drinking as the water had a high concentration of salt. This meant it had a high level of salinity.</p>
