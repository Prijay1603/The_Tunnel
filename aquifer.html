    <br><br><p class="info">An 'aquifer' is water that is stored in the ground. In an aquifer, there are two main types of water, confined water & unconfined water. Whether or not the water is confined depends on what is on top of it. If the water is close to the surface, it is unconfined. However, if has an aquiclude above it, it is considered confined water. If you have ever wondered how rivers are constantly flowing even though it is not raining, it is because of aquifers that are close to the surface. In the story, the aquifer refers to the confined water.</p>
